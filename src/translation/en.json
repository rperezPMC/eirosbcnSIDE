From Barcelona and its ability to transform creativity into functional design, like Gaudí's trencadís, made of unique fragments that together become art and ingenuity, metaphor of our process: layers of carbon fiber arranged with precision, which united create components of high strength, lightness, and functional beauty. And we are also born from the industrial voice of Vallès, which has known how to continually reinvent itself, becoming an engine of progress through technology and innovation.",
